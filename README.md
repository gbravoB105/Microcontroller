# Microcontroller
This project consists of the implementation of a microcontroller for an specific application in VHDL. The microcontroller has a very simplified architecture and a reduced set of instructions, so that using a simple machine code program it is possible to control some elements (switches, level actuators, thermostat, etc.).

For the project it is used the [Nexys 4 DDR development board](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/reference-manual) of DigilentÂ®.

## System Architecture
